## Introduction

### Background

- What is Demand-side management?  
Demand-side management is one approach that can be applied to efficiently manage a site’s energy consumption with the aim of cutting the costs of electrical energy supply.
- To be brief, the purpose is to get a lower cost for electricity consumption. 
- Stakeholders: customers and companies of smart appliance.

### Problem Statement
- If we can allocate working time to smart appliance according to the flowing electricity price, we can make great benefits.
- The decision-maker should be the smart appliance itself, to decide which time to start working in order to get the lowest cost of electricity.
- How to get the value of flowing electricity price?  
We need to build a prediction model for it.

### Next Step
- Whether or not to build a model ourselves?   
Building a model ourselves is too complicated and not reliable due to the number of factors involved and lack of data access.
```{r, out.width='80%', fig.align='center', fig.show = 'hold'}
knitr::include_graphics(here('picture','eia.png'))
```

### Data we have
- Instead of building a model ourselves, we will use the forecast electricity price data generated by NYISO (NewYork Independent System Operator).
- The source of data: https://www.nyiso.com/energy-market-operational-data 
- LBMP: locational based marginal pricing  
```{r, out.width='70%', fig.align='center', fig.show = 'hold'}
knitr::include_graphics(here('picture','price.png'))
```
### Data Descrption
- Forecast electricity price data: every hour’s LBMP based on forecast everyday(every hour's price, one-day ahead).  
```{r, out.width='80%', fig.align='center', fig.show = 'hold'}
knitr::include_graphics(here('picture','data.png'))
```

### Data Description
- Historical real-time electricity price data: real-world recorded LBMP(every 5 minutes' price, continuously updated to today)   
we use the mean value of 12 every 5 minutes' price within each hour to represent its every hours' real-time electricity price.  
```{r, out.width='80%', fig.align='center', fig.show = 'hold'}
knitr::include_graphics(here('picture','data2.png'))
```

## Formalism

### Decision Problem Formalism
Having these price data, We need to generate a recommendation about which time to start working given required working time and working time range to save the cost.
```{r, out.width='100%', fig.align='center', fig.show = 'hold'}
knitr::include_graphics(here('picture','Forma1.png'))
```

### Data generating process
We will use historical real-time and forecast price data to fit a model. Then we can predict the realized price one-day ahead according to the day-ahead predicted data by NYISO. 
```{r, out.width='100%', fig.align='center', fig.show = 'hold'}
knitr::include_graphics(here('picture','Forma2.png'))
```

## Summary

### The purpose of this project
- Build a simple application. After inputing location, working time and working time range, it will suggest a working time for the user.
- Examine the error distribution of our model, whether it follows our assumption. Is there a tendency that higher price brings higher fluctuation.
- Examine the reliability of NYISO's prediction accuracy, whether it has a biase in its prediction and whether we can make adjustments to it.

### Future improvement
- The result of the real-time updated data will be used to test the model's performance and help refine the model.
- Integrate the prediction model rather than directly applying NYISO's prediction data. Evaluate other electricity price prediction models. 
- Add a working time preference variable to our loss function, e.g. set a higher preference level value if you would like your washing to be done as soon as possible.

### Thank you
- Thanks for watching! 
- Any Questions?
